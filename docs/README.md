# Pyxora Documentation

## Getting Started

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/pyxora/
```

Install the dependencies required for documentation:

```bash
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
```

View the documentation locally in the browser (starts a local server):

```bash
python -m docs
```

---

Build static HTML documentation:

```bash
python -m docs --build  # or  python -m docs -b
```

This command creates a build folder with static HTML files that you can host or share.
