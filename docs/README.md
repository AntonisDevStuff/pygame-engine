# Pyxora Documentation

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have **pdoc** installed:

```bash
pip install pdoc
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd path/to/pyxora
```
View documentation in the browser:

```bash
python -m docs
```

---

Build static HTML documentation:

```bash
python -m docs --html
```

This will generate HTML files in the given directory, which you can host or share.
