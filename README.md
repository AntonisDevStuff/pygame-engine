# pyxora

*A simple game engine made with Python and pygame-ce*

**pyxora** is a lightweight abstraction over libraries like [pygame-ce](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce) and others. It's designed to serve as a simple, open-source game engine for building 2D games.

> **Note:** The project is still in early development. It is not recommended for complex project/games at this stage.
